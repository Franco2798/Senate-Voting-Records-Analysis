# Senate Voting Similarity Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. Senate voting records using **Python** and **cosine similarity** to explore how closely senators’ voting patterns align with each other.  

## 📊 Project Overview
The analysis answers questions such as:
1. **Closest senator to Lincoln Chafee (RI)** – based on voting similarity.  
2. **Senator who disagrees the most with Rick Santorum (PA)**.  
3. **Random selection of Democratic and Republican senators** for analysis.  
4. **Classification of Jeffords (VT)** – whether his voting record aligns more with Democrats or Republicans.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **SciPy** (cosine distance for similarity calculation)
- **random** for senator sampling

## 📌 Results Summary
- Exercise 1: Lincoln Chafee’s closest senator is Jeffords (VT).
- Exercise 2: The senator who disagrees most with Rick Santorum is Feingold (WI).
- Exercise 3: Random selection of 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans (reproducible with random_state=42).
- Exercise 4: Jeffords is classified as closer to the Democrats.
